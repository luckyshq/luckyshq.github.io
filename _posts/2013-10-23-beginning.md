Impressed by most of great hackers (not crackers), I find that starting a blog of our own to share technology knowledge is a excellent way, which is good for both blog owner and blog readers,just like you guys.We can promote each other to learn more about the beautiful Internet world.



Today,I set up my first English personal technology blog by using WordPress + BAE(There is something wrong with my WordPress + BAE, so I choose diandian instead), for experience sharing, also English training. I'm very glad to write down my Journey in coding here. Although I'm afraid my poor English will ruin your interests in reading my words, I'm going to try the best I can to get my English better.

THANKS FOR EVERYONE READING!   =v=
